###Swagger-Codegen-Tooling example with Spring-Boot and Jersey.

Complete Spring-Boot example that shows how to use the maven-plugin to generate only JaxRs-Interfaces
and do integration-tests.

Note:
The integration-test in this project only uses one call to server-application. It is the only implemented
call by me. More is up to you. ;-)

But should be enough for an simple showcase.
