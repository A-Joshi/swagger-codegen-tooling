Goal of this project is to provide tooling for Maven projects (and maybe Gradle) to generate code from swagger-definitions (yaml or json)
during build. This is not a onetime-generator. Code will be generated at every build to make sure your implementation
matches your api.

It also provides different templates for code-generation.
